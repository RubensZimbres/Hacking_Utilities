Creating a chatbot for a customer service solution involves several phases: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing improvement. Here's a comprehensive project plan, broken down into each stage with key tasks, timeline, and responsible roles.
Project Overview
Objective: To build a customer service chatbot that effectively handles customer inquiries, reduces support ticket load, and improves response times.
Scope: The chatbot will assist with FAQ, basic troubleshooting, account management, and general inquiries. It will provide 24/7 support, and route complex queries to live agents.
Tools and Technologies: Natural Language Processing (NLP) frameworks (Dialogflow, Rasa, Microsoft Bot Framework, etc.), AI/ML models (GPT-based or similar), backend systems integration, and frontend (web and mobile) interfaces.
